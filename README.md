# Presentation Pacer

A lightweight VBA macro for PowerPoint that shows a segmented countdown clock in the top-right corner during a slide show, so a presenter always knows how much time is left for the current part of the talk.

## What it does

During the slide show (F5), a clock appears in the top-right corner:

- **Green** — on schedule
- **Orange** — less than 30s left in the current segment's time budget
- **Red with "+"** — over budget (shows by how much)

The clock **resets automatically** whenever you move into a new slide range, and counts down the time allotted to that segment only — so the presenter immediately sees how much time remains for their part, regardless of how much time has already elapsed. For example:

- Slides 1–5 → clock starts at **5:00** and counts down
- Slides 6–10 → on entering slide 6, the clock resets and starts at **15:00**

## Files

- `PrezentacjaZegar.bas` — main VBA module (`ModZegar`) with the clock logic and segment definitions
- `ClsPresEvents.cls` — class module (`KlasaZdarzen`) that wires up slide show events
- `INSTRUKCJA_zegar_prezentacji.md` — installation instructions (Polish)

## Setup

See [`INSTRUKCJA_zegar_prezentacji.md`](INSTRUKCJA_zegar_prezentacji.md) for step-by-step installation instructions.

Quick summary:

1. Enable the Developer tab (File → Options → Customize Ribbon → check "Developer")
2. Open the VBA editor (Developer → Visual Basic, or Alt+F11)
3. Import `PrezentacjaZegar.bas` (adds module `ModZegar`)
4. Edit the `ranges` array in `GetSegmentInfo` to match your agenda:
   ```vba
   ranges = Array( _
       Array(1, 5, 5), _
       Array(6, 10, 15), _
       Array(11, 999, 30) _
   )
   ```
   Each row is `(start slide, end slide, duration of this segment in minutes)`.
5. Import `ClsPresEvents.cls` (adds class `KlasaZdarzen`)
6. Manually run macro `InitEvents` once per session (Alt+F8 → `InitEvents` → Run), before starting the slide show — `Auto_Open` doesn't run in `.pptm` files
7. Save the file as `.pptm` (macro-enabled presentation)
8. Enable macros on first open, run `InitEvents` again, then start the slide show (F5)

## Notes

- The clock draws an invisible-to-nobody textbox named `ClockBox` only on the slide currently shown during the slide show — it won't clutter other slides in edit view.
- If you want the clock visible only on the presenter's screen (not the audience's), VBA alone can't split that — a separate Presenter View + a browser-based tool on your monitor would be needed instead.
- The clock only resets when entering a **different** segment than the one currently counting down. Moving between slides within the same segment doesn't reset it.
- Going back to a previous segment also resets the clock to the full duration of that segment (it doesn't remember how much time was already used).

## Platform notes

`PrezentacjaZegar.bas` is written for **macOS** PowerPoint, where `Application.OnTime` is not available — the clock updates on every slide change rather than every second.
